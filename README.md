# Readme-Generator
A Node JS application to help you generate a professional README file.

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a professional README generator to make it easy for developers to get a README.md file started. 
 
-When you go to your terminal and you enter node index.js you are prompted with questions about your project.
 
-After answering all of the questions you then can go to the readme demo and look at personal README generated for your project.
